      <li>A pizza with specific toppings will be displayed for 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>You must build the pizza using the ingredients and serve it before the time runs out by clicking on the Serve button.</li>
      <li>As you progress, the levels become harder as more ingredients are added to the pizzas, and the orders start to get more and more out of control. Keep your customers happy!</li>
